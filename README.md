# birthdayparadox-py
This project is my solution the Birthday Paradox problem from The Big Book of Small Python Projects

Description:
The Birthday Paradox, also called the
Birthday Problem, is the surprisingly high
probability that two people will have the
same birthday even in a small group of people.
In a group of 70 people, there’s a 99.9 percent chance
of two people having a matching birthday. But even
in a group as small as 23 people, there’s a 50 percent
chance of a matching birthday. This program per-
forms several probability experiments to determine
the percentages for groups of different sizes. We call these types of experi-
ments, in which we conduct multiple random trials to understand the
likely outcomes, Monte Carlo experiments.
